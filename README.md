# DeceptiLens
## Introduction
In this project, we collected reported Dark Pattern / Deceptive Pattern (DP) screenshots from different sources, such as academic publications, reports and websites. 
We propose "DeceptiLens" as a robust and transparent DP detection approach. We employ multimodal-LLM, specifically GPT-4o, and apply RAG to minimize incorrect outputs. DeceptiLens is not only for capturing DPs in the UI, but also providing explanation about the reasoning behind each identification process. We utilize prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and instruct the model for a certain output structure. 

## Datasets
### 1. Input data
All of the collected data is available under the "data" folder.
### 2. Model's classification and explanations
Classification of the input data with explanations is available under the "model-output" folder.
### 3. Experts' classification
Classification of the input data by experts. Each example was evaluated by three different experts.
